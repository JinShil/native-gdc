# native-gdc
Script for building a native [GDC D compiler](https://github.com/D-Programming-GDC/GDC).

NOTE: This will build from GCC 9.  GCC 9 has the GDC frontend written in C++ (v2.067).  It is primarily intended as a bootstrap compiler for building GCC 10, which I believe will have the GDC frontend written in D.
